This repository hosts a comprehensive curriculum designed to build expert-level SQL proficiency for Data Scientist, Senior Data Scientist, and AI/ML Engineer roles.

This is **not** an exhaustive list of every SQL command. It is a strategically prioritized learning path that reflects the realities of the data science interview. The curriculum de-emphasizes database administration tasks and focuses intensely on what interviewers test: **advanced data querying, complex data manipulation, analytical pattern recognition, and performance optimization**.

The objective is to move beyond simple command memorization and develop the ability to **"think in SQL"**.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository (Get Started)

This repository is built for a step-by-step learning experience. Here is the recommended path:

1.  **Start with the Curriculum:** Open and read **`The Complete SQL Curriculum for Interviews.md`**. This is the core 12-module textbook for this entire repo. Start with Module 1.
2.  **Practice by Module:** After you finish a module in the curriculum file, navigate to the **`./General-Practice-Questions/`** folder. Find the matching module sub-folder (e.g., `Module-03-Aggregation/`) and work through the practice questions in the text files.
3.  **Prepare for Interviews:** Once you feel confident, go to the **`./Company-Wise-Questions/`** folder. Pick a company you're targeting and test your skills against real-world questions.
